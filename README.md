# CS-360

The requirements of this application were to create two databases to house user and event information. Users need to have the ability to update, delete, and create events. The application must have a log in screen so that new users can create their own log in. The application also needs to ask permission to text user when events are coming up.  

For this project, I tried to keep the design simple. The application is composed of a log in, create account, and event screen. Ideally you would be able to navigate to each page in order to make the changes that the user would like. I kept the buttons large for easy utilization for all ages. In designing this application, I started with the requirements to build a body for the application and then built upon that to provide the extra effects and cosmetic cleanliness of the application. I tested the application regularly on my own phone to ensure functionality. There is one issue that I have with populating the event information data table, but I am still working on this to complete it. It is always very important to catch any errors as fast as possible so that they are addressed. Ironically, one of the hardest challenges beyond that data table was the color design of the project. I am an artist myself and I felt completely overwhelmed with picking color schemes. I overcame this by looking at other examples and utilizing those. With this application, I felt that I was very successful with creating the log in process.
